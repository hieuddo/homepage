On July 28, 2020, amidst the controlled pandemic situation in Vietnam, the University of Engineering and Technology, VNUH, organized a remarkable in-person Graduation Ceremony for the class of 2020.</br></br>

Even with the prevailing sense of safety, attendees were seen wearing masks to prioritize their well-being and protection during the event.

One of the cherished moments from that day was when I proudly received my certificate from the Dean of UET.

I also took the opportunity to capture memories with my classmates, forming an unforgettable picture with everyone's names listed in the caption.

Having keen interest in Machine Learning, we form a closely-knit group that shares the same passion. During a special gathering, we seized the opportunity to capture a memorable moment together.

Among the attendees was my close friend, Hoang, who was already on the path to hunt for a PhD scholarship at SMU back in 2020 (now a PhD student since 2022), and we happily shared a cherished moment together.
